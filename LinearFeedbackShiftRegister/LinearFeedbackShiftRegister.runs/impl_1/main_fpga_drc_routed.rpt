CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

LUTLP-1#1 Warning
Combinatorial Loop Alert  
6 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops. If the loop is known and understood, this DRC can be bypassed by acknowledging the condition and setting the following XDC constraint on any net in the loop: 'set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS TRUE [net_nets <myHier/myNet>'. The cells in the loop are: lfsr/Currstate[0]_i_5, lfsr/Currstate[0]_i_6, lfsr/Currstate[0]_i_8, lfsr/Currstate[0]_i_9, lfsr/Currstate[0]_i_10, lfsr/Currstate[0]_i_12.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net lfsr/Control_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin lfsr/Control_reg_i_2/O, cell lfsr/Control_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net lfsr/eqOp is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin lfsr/button_reg_i_1/O, cell lfsr/button_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port btn[0] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>
